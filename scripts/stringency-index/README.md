The scripts in this subdirectory are used to find the correlation between the norms as reported in this work, 
and the stringency index as reported by https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-stringency-index, to see if
the policies we generate can be assigned a stringency index as well, that is calculated in a manner consistent
with globally reported values.

The data for the stringency index reported in the link above is recorded by the Github account 
[OxCGRT](https://github.com/OxCGRT).
For the purposes of this work, we are interested in the data 
[reported on the level of individual US states](https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy), specifically
the data related to the state of Virginia (VA), for which we use the data reported in the 
[US-timeseries_all.xlsx](https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy/blob/master/data/OxCGRTUS_timeseries_all.xlsx)
file.
